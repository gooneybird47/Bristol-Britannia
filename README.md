### AI Aircraft for FlightGear

*This is still WIP but does currently work.*

Download the zip file and extract the "Britannia" folder into the "$FG_ROOT/AI/Aircraft" folder.

To use you will need to create a traffic file, see the wiki for instructions.

If you are familiar with Python there is a simple AI Traffic Creator here:

I have included a few traffic files that are based on the actual routes flown but the times are not accurate. 
To use drop the "brit-traffic" folder into the "data\AI\Traffic\" folder.
